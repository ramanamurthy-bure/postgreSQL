/************************************************ ORDER BY ********************************************************\
-> You may have noticed PostgreSQL sometimes returns the same request query results in a different order
-> You can use ORDER BY to sort rows based on a column value, in either ascending or descending order
Basic Synax for Order BY :
SELECT column_1,column_2 FROM table ORDER BY column_1 ASC/DESC
-> Use ASC to sort in ascending order
-> Use DESC to sort in descending order
-> If you leave it blank, ORDER BY uses ASC by default
-> You can also ORDER BY multiple columns
-> This makes sense when one column has duplicate entries
