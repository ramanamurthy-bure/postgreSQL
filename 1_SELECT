/************************************SELETCT*************************************************************************\
-> SELECT is the most common statement used, and it allows us to retrieve information from a table.Later on we will learn how to
combine SELECT with other statements to perform more complex queries
Example syntax for SELECT statement:
SELECT column_name FROM table_name
-> In general it is not a good practice to use an asterisk(*) in the SELECT statement if you don't really need all columns
-> It will automatically query everything, which increases traffic between the database server and the application, which 
can slow down the retrieval of results

--To get all the rows and columns from the table
SELECT * FROM actor;

--To get the column name 'first_name' from the table
SELECT first_name FROM actor;

--To get the column name 'first_name' from the table
SELECT first_name,last_name FROM actor;

--Use a SELECT statement to grab the first and last names of every customer and their e-mail address
SELECT first_name,last_name,email FROM customer
