/************************************COUNT*************************************************************************\
-> The COUNT function returns the number of input rows that specific condition of a query.
-> We can apply COUNT on a specific column or just pass COUNT(*), we will soon see this should return the same results
-> Syntax : SELECT COUNT(column name) FROM table;
-> color_table:
            first_name        choice
            Zach              Green
            David             Green
            Claire            Yellow
            David             Red
-> SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM color_table; Here parnthesis is mandatory.
-> In fact, it should be the same regardless of the column.
Output: 
            COUNT
              4

/*
1. SELECT COUNT(first_name) FROM color_table:
2. SELECT COUNT(choice) FROM color_table:
3. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM color_table:

All the above queries return same thing, since the original table had 4 rows

-> Because of this COUNT by itself simply returns back a count of the number of rows in a table
-> COUNT is much more useful when combined with other commands, such as DISTINCT

-> Imagine we wanted to know: How many unique names are there in the table?
-> SELECT DISTINCT(first_name) FROM color_table;
-> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(rating)) FROM film;
*/

-- To get all the rows from the film table
SELECT * FROM film;

-- To get all the rows count from the film table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM film;

-- TO get the count of rows which are distinct
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT rating) FROM film; --5

-- This is similar to above query. However some people find it more readable
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(rating)) FROM film; --5

SELECT * FROM payment;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payment; -- 14596
SELECT COUNT(payment_id) FROM payment; -- 14596

-- To fetch all the amounts from payment table
SELECT amount FROM payment;

-- To remove the duplicate amounts or to find the unique amounts
SELECT DISTINCT amount FROM payment;

-- To find the count of the rows which are having unique amounts
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT amount) FROM payment; --19
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(amount)) FROM payment; --19
