/************************************************ BETWEEN ********************************************************\
-> The BETWEEN operator can be used to match a value against a range of values:
-> value >= low AND value <= high
-> value BETWEEN low AND high
    For Example, 
        If we want value BETWEEN 8 AND 9. Here 8 and 9 are inclusive

-> The NOT BETWEEN operator is same as:
-> value < low OR value > high
-> value NOT BETWEEN low AND high
    For Example, 
        If we want value NOT BETWEEN 8 AND 9. Here 8 and 9 are NOT inclusive.
        
-> The BETWEEN operator can also be used with dates. Note that you need to format dates in the ISO 8601 standard format
which is YYYY-MM-DD
    -> date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-02-01'
    
-> When using BETWEEN operator with dates that also include timestamp information, pay careful attention to using
BETWEEN versus <=,>= comparison operators,due to the fact that a datetime starts at 0:00
-> Later on we will study more specific methods for datetime information types

-- While working with datetime column in conjuction with BETWEEN we need to considre the time as well. 
-- The above query wont return the results upto 2007-02-14 0:00 hrs. We need to use the below query to include
