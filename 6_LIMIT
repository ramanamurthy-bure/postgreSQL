/************************************************ LIMIT ********************************************************\
-> The LIMIT command allows us to limit the number of rows returned for a query
-> Useful for not wanting to return every single row in a table, but only view the top few rows to get an idea of the
table layout
-> LIMIT also becomes useful in combination with ORDER BY
-> LIMIT goes at the very end of a query request and is the last command to be executed
-> Let's learn the basic syntax of LIMIT through some examples
