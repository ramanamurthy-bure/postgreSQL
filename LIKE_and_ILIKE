/************************************************ LIKE and ILIKE ********************************************************\
-> Using pattern Matching
-> We've already been able to perform direct comparisons against strnigs, such as 
    -> WHERE first_name='John'
-> But what if we want to match gainst a general pattern in a sting?
    -> All emails ending in '@gmail.com'
    -> All names that begin with an 'A'

-> The LIKE operator allows us to perform pattern matching against string data with the use of wildcard characters:
    ->  Percent %
        -> Matches any sequence of characters
    ->  Underscore _
        -> Matches any single character
Examples:
    1.All names that begin with an 'A'
        -> WHERE name LIKE 'A%'
    2.All names that end with an 'a'
        -> WHERE name LIKE '%a'
        Notice that LIKE is case-sensitive, we can use ILIKE which is case-insensitive
    3.Using the underscore allows us to replace just a single character
        -> Get all Mission Impossible films
        -> WHERE title LIKE 'Mission Impossible _'
-> You can use multiple underscores
    -> Imagine we had version string codes in the format 'Version#A4','Version#B7', etc...
         -> WHERE value LIKE 'Version#__'

-> We can also combine pattern matching operators to create more complex patterns
    -> WHERE name LIKE '_her%'
           -Chery!
           -Theresa
           -Sherri
