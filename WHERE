/************************************WHERE*************************************************************************\

-> SELECT and WHERE are the most fundamental SQL statements and you will find yourself using them often!
-> The WHERE statement allows us to specify conditions on columns for the rows to be returned
Basic Syntax:
        SELECT column1,column2
        FROM table
        WHERE conditions;
        
-> The WHERE clause appears immediately after the FROM clause of the SELECT statement
-> The conditions are used to filter the rows returned from the SELECT statement
-> PostgreSQL provides a variety of standard operators to construct the conditions

Comparison Operators:
    -> Compare a column value to something:
    -> Is the price greater than $3.00?
    -> Is the pet's name equal to 'Sam'?
    
    Operator            Description
        =               Equal
        >               Greater than
        <               Less than
        >=              Greater than or equal to
        <=              Less than or equal to
        <> or !=        Not equal to
        
Logical Operators:  
-> Allow us to combine multiple comparison operators
        -> AND
        -> OR
        -> NOT
        
-> color_table:
            first_name        choice
            Zach              Green
            David             Green
            Claire            Yellow
            David             Red
      
-> To get the both columns from the color_table
    -> SELECT first_name,choice FROM color_table
-> Now let's get only the people named David
    -> SELECT * FROM color_table WHERE first_name='David';
    -> SELECT first_name,choice FROM color_table WHERE first_name='David';
    -> SELECT first_name,choice FROM color_table WHERE first_name='David' AND choice='Red';
